    <h2>Minimize the number of times you actually check your email.</h2>
    <p>
        Most emails aren't going to require immediate followup. Check your email 3 to 4 times a day and set aside a specific time
        and duration to do it.
    </p>

        <h1>The Email Domain Rule</h1>
        <p>Move Emails that don't come from the Company you work for or your clients</p>
        <p>This filters out most spam emails and newsletters.  These definitely don't need your immediate attention.</p>

        <h1>The BCC or Distro List Rule</h1>
        <p>Move Emails that don't specifically have your email in the TO or CC lines.</p>
        <p>This filter catches most email distribution lists and rarely need immediate action. It should be marked high priority if it does need immediate action.</p>

        <h1>The CC Rule</h1>

        <h1>The Invite and Accept Rule</h1>
        <p>
            Meeting invites typically do need prompt followup.  Move these into a separate folder so that it is easier to see when you receive a meeting invite.

        <h1>Order Matters</h1>
        <p>
            Outlook cares about which rule comes first. You'll actually generate duplicate emails if you aren't careful.
