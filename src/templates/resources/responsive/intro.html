    <h1>Handling websites on Mobile</h1>
    <p>
        The popularity of smart phones created a massive need for websites to be accessible on small screens. It is now almost expected
        for all sites to be responsive.

        <h3>WAP - Wireless Application Protocol</h3>
        <p>
            Introduced in 1999. Very very simplistic websites. Almost completely gone by 2013.

    <div class="fragment">
        <h3>Adaptive</h3>
        <p>
            Very similar to responsive, but had hard defined breakpoints. Sites would perform significant UI changes at certain resolutions.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment">
        <h3>Responsive</h3>
        <p>
            The website shifts content size and arrangement based on screen size. Elements grow and shrink fluidly with the layout.
