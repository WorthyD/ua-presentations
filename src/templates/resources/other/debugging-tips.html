    <h1>Tips for debugging code.</h1>
    <p>
        We all get stuck from time to time with broken code. We know what it needs to do, but don't know why it isn't doing what
        we expect.

        If you use a calculator and plug in 4+4 and it ends up saying 0, don't assume the calculator is broken.

    <h1>Batch your work.</h1>
    <p>
        Don't write 20 or 30 lines of code without testing what you have written.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Batch your work into smaller units to understand what is going on.
    </p>

        Bugs are easier to find when they are small.

    <h1>Example</h1>
    <p>
        I want to validate a form field when I click a button.
    </p>
    <pre class="fragment"><code class="js">
            $('btn').on('click', function(){
                console.log('click worked');
            });
            </code></pre>
    <p class="fragment">
        I test that my click is working before continuing with my work.
    </p>
    <pre class="fragment"><code class="js">
            $('btn').on('click', function(){
                console.log($('input').val());
            });
            </code></pre>

    <h1>Read the documentation.</h1>
    <p>
        Using a third party library can be hard at times. Good libraries provide good documentation, examples and demos. Study them
        to understand how they should be used.

    <h1>Read your error messages</h1>
    <p>
        Most error messages by your editor or browser point you to the exact line that is broken.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        If you can't tell what's going on, copy and paste that into Google.

    <h1>Use caution when copy and pasting examples.</h1>
    <p>
        You loose understanding when copy and pasting someone elses code.

    <h1>Remember Errors are opportunities to learn.</h1>

        You wont learn anything if everything worked the first time you try it.
